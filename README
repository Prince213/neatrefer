NEATREFER
=========

Neatrefer troff preprocessor is a small refer clone for managing
bibliographic references.  It assumes each record in the database has
an 'L' key, which specifies the label of the record.  When
referencing, only this key is looked up among the records in the
database.  Thus, neatrefer is not compatible with the original refer.

With -m option, neatrefer allows multiple references in a single .[/.]
macro, as space or comma separated list of labels; refer tries to use
reference intervals for them if possible.  Also, inline citation
macros are supported with -o option; e.g., with -ocite option,
\*[cite label] can be used for citing a reference with key label.
