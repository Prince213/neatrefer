NEATREFER
=========

Neatrefer troff preprocessor is a small refer clone for managing
bibliographic references.  It assumes each record in the database has
an 'L' key which specifies the label of the record.  When referencing,
only this key is searched among the records in the database; thus
neatrefer is not compatible with the original refer.  A new -m
parameter has been added to allow multiple references in a single
.[/.] macro, as white space separated list of labels; refer tries to
use reference intervals if possible.
